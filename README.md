# Viz-a-thon
Viz-a-ton is a multi-week virtual contest by the National Center for State Courts (NCSC) to create a supportable, interactive, data visualization of the state court structure charts. "The State Court Structure Charts summarize in diagrams the key features of each state’s court organization. The purpose of the Viz-a-thon is to create a user-friendly interactive online tool that facilitates comparability between state court structures and characteristics and which simplifies the administration of the publication."
